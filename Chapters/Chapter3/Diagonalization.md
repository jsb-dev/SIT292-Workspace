# Diagonalization Algorithm

To diagonalize an n×n matrix A:

1. Find the distinct eigenvalues λ of A.
2. Compute a set of basic eigenvectors corresponding to each of these eigenvalues λ as basic solutions of the homogeneous system (λ I −A)x = 0.
3. The matrix A is diagonalizable if and only if there are n basic eigenvectors in all.
4. If A is diagonalizable, the n×n matrix P with these basic eigenvectors as its columns is a diagonalizing matrix for A, that is, P is invertible and P−1AP is diagonal.
