# Applications (Chapter 1)

## Ohm's Law

The current I and the voltage drop V across a resistance R are related by the equation V = RI.

## Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws

1. (Junction Rule) The current flow into a junction equals the current flow out of that junction.
2. (Circuit Rule) The algebraic sum of the voltage drops (due to resistances) around any closed
circuit of the network must equal the sum of the voltage increases around the circuit.
