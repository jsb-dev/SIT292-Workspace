# Gaussian Elimination

To solve a system of linear equations proceed as follows:

1. Carry the augmented matrix to a reduced row-echelon matrix using elementary row
operations.

2. If a row [ 0 0 0 ··· 0 1 ] occurs, the system is inconsistent.

3. Otherwise, assign the nonleading variables (if any) as parameters, and use the equations
corresponding to the reduced row-echelon matrix to solve for the leading variables in terms
of the parameters.
