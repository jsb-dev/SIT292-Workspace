## Chapter 1

### 1.1 Elementary Operations

The following operations, called elementary operations, can routinely be performed on systems
of linear equations to produce equivalent systems.

I. Interchange two equations.
II. Multiply one equation by a nonzero number.
III. Add a multiple of one equation to a different equation.

### 1.2 Elementary Row Operations

The following are called elementary row operations on a matrix.

I. Interchange two rows.
II. Multiply one row by a nonzero number.
III. Add a multiple of one row to a different row.

### 1.3 Reduced Row-Echelon Form

A matrix is said to be in row-echelon form (and will be called a row-echelon matrix) if it satisfies the following three conditions:

1. All zero rows (consisting entirely of zeros) are at the bottom.
2. The first nonzero entry from the left in each nonzero row is a 1, called the leading 1 for that row.
3. Each leading 1 is to the right of all leading 1s in the rows above it. A row-echelon matrix is said to be in reduced row-echelon form (and will be called a reduced row-echelon matrix) if, in addition, it satisfies the following condition.
4. Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.

### 1.4 Rank of a Matrix

The rank of matrix A is the number of leading 1s in any row-echelon matrix to which A can be carried by row operations.

### 1.5 Basic Solutions

The gaussian algorithm systematically produces solutions to any homogeneous linear system, called basic solutions, one for every parameter.
