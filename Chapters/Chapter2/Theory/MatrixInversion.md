# Matrix Inversion Algorithm

If A is an invertible (square) matrix, there exists a sequence of elementary row operations that carry
A to the identity matrix I of the same size, written

A → I.

This same series of row operations carries I to A−1; that is, I →A−1. The algorithm can be summarized as follows:

[ A I ] → [ I A−1 ]

where the row operations on A and I are carried out simultaneously.
